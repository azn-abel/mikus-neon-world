### Letter to Judging Committee

Hello Judging Committee,

We are college computer science students in America with keen interests in
Japanese culture and media. Earlier this summer, we learned about the Magical
Mirai Programming Competition from Hatsune Miku's English Facebook page. We 
entered because we saw it as an opportunity not only to learn about web
development, but also to express our appreciation for Japanese culture and
Hatsune Miku.

Thank you for the time and efforts you all have dedicated ot this competition. We
look forward to hearing the results!

All the best,  
Wolfpack Mirai 2023
